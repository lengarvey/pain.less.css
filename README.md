# PAIN.LESS.CSS

Welcome to the `pain.less.css`! The goal of this project is to build
a `CSS` framework that wouldn't inflict such a pain on its users.

Blawords, aside, i'm building a css framework that will require as
little of HTML adjustments as possible in order to make things look
good. It relies on the original meaning of the HTML tags and the
powers of the LESS language to make things easy to use.
