          <h1>Painless CSS, The Manifesto</h1>

          <p>
            I love the web, and I'm not trying to say that by picking
            a different css framework than me, you therefore love it less than I.
            I'm just trying to say that I find its simplicity, flexibility
            and an infinite number of ways to combine things together, beautiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately things where getting utterly complex lately, we have
            to squeeze more and more stuff in our markup and content in order
            to make the things look great. And that's not an enjoyable process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, we do automate all everything, and no one really writes HTML
            by hands anymore (although right at this moment I do), but this
            process is like a snowball. We have complex CSS frameworks, so we
            generate our HTML through abstraction layers, and as we automate
            the templates, we lower our threshold and let the CSS side to get
            even more complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somewhere in this rush we loose the original simplicity and innocence
            of the web. Surely you do need all the heavy lifting tools and they
            are fully justified in many cases. But, in many cases they're not.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that humans are striving for simplicity, I believe that
            most of the things in HTML already have enough context for us to
            paint it pretty.
          </p>
          <pre><code lang="html">&lt;button>Hey, I'm a button!&lt;/button>
&lt;input type="text" placeholder="I'm totally an input field!">
&lt;button type="submit">I submit stuff&lt;/button></code></pre>
          <p>
            Which gets us to the goal of this project.
          </p>

          <a id="goal"></a>
          <h2>The Goal</h2>

          <p>
            Lets pretend for a second that the good old HTML, the way
            our lord and savior Tim Berners-Lee envisioned it, already
            have enough data and context for us to paint it sanely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lets pretend that we can write our HTML in semantical and
            meaningful structures, just like when we were young and fresh
            out of the bootcamp. And still, with those simple and innocent
            structures, get a great and maintainable look.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lets pretend that a CSS framework can be as painless and simple
            as a plain css-reset. You just throw it in and everything looks
            awesome. No ties to a vendor, no three classes and four extra
            elements scaffolding. It's just there when you need it.
          </p>
          <p>
            And lets pretend that by doing so, we create space for the good
            things, the things that matter. Because making things look
            decently out of the box is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
            As a good foundation gives you better chances to make it.
